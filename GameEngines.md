Some engines are native zaurus binaries and some are plain GP2X binaries
that execute via [GINGE](GINGE.md).

**All game engines require game data to run properly!**

Information on how to install these data files can be found in the readme files.

**Every** game engine has a readme file in it's directory.

## Albion ##

---

Albion is a single player role-playing video game developed and published by Blue Byte Software for MS-DOS in 1995.
This binary is a statically recompiled executable of the original Albion executable to the GP2X by M-HT.

  * Native GP2X binary.
  * Runs fullspeed with 44100Hz sound.

**Keybindings:**

  * L.ALT, O - Ingame Left mouse button
  * R.CTRL, I - Ingame right mouse button
  * Z, 9 - toggle screen scaling
  * 0, X - "y" character
  * MINUS - Show map
  * Shoulder Cancel Button - Switch between mouse and keyboard mode
  * Shoulder Ok Button - Virtual keyboard (**Does not work!**)
  * SPACE - Pause/Resume game
  * Z, 9 + Shoulder Ok Button - Ingame backspace key

**Known bugs:**

Albion comes with a virtual keyboard since the GP2X doesn't have one.
However, if you try to open it, the game will crash. This is a bit of
a problem since you cannot save games without a keyboard. But, if you press
O or X in the "Please enter a name for this saved game:" dialog, you will
get a "y" character. So there you go, you can still name your save games with
a variable number of "y" letters. :)

  * Native Zaurus binary

Free implementation of Heroes of the Might and Magic II engine.

slow.

OpenTyrian does not use the alternate movement key mappings (1,q,2,w,3,e).
