ZGrom comes with MPlayer 1.0rc4. This port uses the pxafb YUV overlay
and supports VGA and QVGA resolutions.

  * OSD is not yet implemented.
  * Double buffering is not yet implemented so expect to see lots of tearing on fast moving movie scenes.
  * **rotation is not implemented!** Movies have to be prerotated.
