# ZGrom keymap #

---



ZGrom's keymap is mostly identical with the one that shipped with old PdaXrom roms.

The F1-F12 keys are mapped to function keys in the following manner:

  * Calendar - F1 F6 F11
  * Address - F2 F7 F12
  * Mail - F3 F8
  * Home - F4 F9
  * Menu - F5 F10

F1 - F5 are mapped directly to function keys. F6 - F10 are a mapped to SHIFT+function keys.
F11 - F12 are mapped to CTRL+function keys.

**Alternate movement & action button mapping**

A gaming rom requires a comfortable way of holding the device while using it. Using the Zaurii d-pad for gaming was not adequate so a different way of holding the device was devised. Almost every ZGrom emulator and game engine has keys mapped in a way that your thumbs are closest to the screen. This is a more comfortable way of holding the device.
Almost every game and emulator has the following alternate keymappings for movement keys:

  * 1,Q - Left
  * 2 - Up
  * W - Down
  * 3,E, Right

Naturally, the dpad can also be used for movement.

Action buttons are almost always mapped to the following keys:

  * I,L.CTRL
  * O,L.ALT
  * 9,X
  * 0,9

The abovementioned keymappings might seem a bit strange at first but they work great when one gets accustomed to it. Naturally, the action buttons are mapped differently to emulated action buttons in each emulator.


Some of the emulated machines have L and R shoulder buttons. These are mapped to OK and CANCEL shoulder buttons on zaurii devices.

**Volume control**

Most emulators and game engines have Volume down/up mapped to V and B keys.
